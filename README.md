# Credit Risk Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the performance of machine learning models using a credit card dataset to make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results

### Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
I first oversampled the data using naive random oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, and undersampling algorithms to predict credit risk.
